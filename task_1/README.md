# Automating User and Group Management with a Bash Script
Managing users and groups on a Unix-like system can be a tedious and error-prone task if done manually. To streamline this process, you can use a Bash script that automates user and group creation, sets up home directories, generates random passwords, and logs all actions. Below is an in-depth explanation of such a script.

# Explanation
## 1. Root Privileges Check
The script begins by checking if it is being run with root privileges, as user and group management requires such access. If the script is not run as root, it exits with an error message.

    if [[ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]]; then
        echo "This script must be run as root." >&2
        exit 1
    fi

## 2. Argument Check
Next, it checks if the correct number of arguments is provided. The script expects one argument: the path to a text file containing usernames and groups.

    if [[ $# -ne 1 ]]; then
        echo "Usage: $0 <text-file>" >&2
        exit 1
    fi

## 3. File Existence Check
The script then verifies if the provided file exists. If not, it exits with an error message.

    if [[ ! -f "$CONTENT_FILE" ]]; then
        echo "File $CONTENT_FILE does not exist." >&2
        exit 1
    fi

## 4. Log and Password File Setup
The script ensures the log and password files are created and have appropriate permissions.

    touch "$LOG_FILE"
    mkdir -p /var/secure
    chown -R $(whoami) /var/secure

## 5. Password Generation Function
A function to generate random passwords is defined. It uses tr to create a string of random characters.

    generate_password() {
        tr -dc 'A-Za-z0-9!@#$%^&*()' < /dev/urandom | head -c 8
    }

## 6. User and Group Creation Loop
The main part of the script reads the input file line by line, creating users and groups accordingly.

    while IFS=';' read -r USERNAME GROUPS; do
        useradd -m -s /bin/bash "$USERNAME" &>> "$LOG_FILE"
        groupadd "$USERNAME" &>> "$LOG_FILE"
        usermod -aG "$USERNAME" "$USERNAME" &>> "$LOG_FILE"

For each user, it also processes additional groups they should be part of, generates a password, and logs these actions.
        IFS=',' read -ra group_array <<< "$GROUPS"
        for group in "${group_array[@]}"; do
            groupadd "$group" &>> "$LOG_FILE"
            usermod -aG "$group" "$USERNAME" &>> "$LOG_FILE"
        done

        password=$(generate_password)
        echo "$USERNAME:$password" | chpasswd &>> "$LOG_FILE"
        echo "User '$USERNAME' created with GROUPS: $GROUPS" >> "$LOG_FILE"
        echo "$USERNAME,$password" >> "$PASSWORD_FILE"
    done < "$CONTENT_FILE"

## 7. Setting Permissions and Final Messages
Finally, the script sets the appropriate permissions for the password file and prints completion messages.

    chmod 600 "$PASSWORD_FILE"
    echo "User creation completed." 
    echo "Detailed logs stored in $LOG_FILE."
    echo "Passwords are stored in $PASSWORD_FILE."

## Usage

To use this script, save it as create_users.sh, make it executable, and run it with a file containing the usernames and groups:

    chmod +x create_users.sh
    sudo ./create_users.sh users.txt

The users.txt file should contain entries in the format username;group1,group2,.... For example:

    john;admin,developers
    jane;developers

This script simplifies user and group management, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of errors.
